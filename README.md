# ESIR_L2_BDD_TP2
Website project worked on during the 2nd year at ESIR (L2)

It is a project carried out as part of ESIR's **BDD-IHM** course in the **2nd year of CUPGE (L2)**.
Its aim is to put into practice the notions learned in **HTML** and **CSS**.

The ticketing form is not functional; it is there to show the sending of data using POST, but the processing page doesn't exist. 

**Bootstrap** is mandatory for this project.
